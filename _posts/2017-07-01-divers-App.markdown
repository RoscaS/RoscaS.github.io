## [* Do you have an epic app idea](https://www.designforfounders.com/app-idea/)  

Il veut vendre son bouquin mais il y a quand même deux trois idées interessantes dans l'article:
Entre autres la prévalence du design sur le soft en lui même pour le prototipage.

Bottom line, on peut avoir zero code et uniquement un concepte en béton + un plan d'interface faite sur photoshop et quand même trouver des investisseurs alors que l'inverse n'est pas possible.


## [** idea-paulGraham](http://www.paulgraham.com/ideas.html)   

>Treating a startup idea as a question changes what you're looking for. If an idea is a blueprint, it has to be right. But if it's a question, it can be wrong, so long as it's wrong in a way that leads to more ideas.

-------

> why do you need other people? Can't you just think of new ideas yourself? The empirical answer is: no. Even Einstein needed people to bounce ideas off. Ideas get developed in the process of explaining them to the right kind of person. You need that resistance, just as a carver needs the resistance of the wood.

-------

Un peu HS mais j'aime beaucoup:  

>Perhaps letting your mind wander is like doodling with ideas. You have certain mental gestures you've learned in your work, and when you're not paying attention, you keep making these same gestures, but somewhat randomly. **In effect, you call the same functions on random arguments. That's what a metaphor is: a function applied to an argument of the wrong type.**

-------

>I found spam intolerable, and I felt it had to be possible to recognize it statistically. And it turns out that was all you needed to solve the problem. The algorithm I used was ridiculously simple. Anyone who'd really tried to solve the problem would have found it. It was just that no one had really tried to solve the problem. 

>**Let me repeat that recipe: finding the problem intolerable and feeling it must be possible to solve it. Simple as it seems, that's the recipe for a lot of startup ideas.**

-------

>Wealth is what people want. I don't mean that as some kind of philosophical statement; I mean it as a tautology.

>So an idea for a startup is an idea for something people want. Wouldn't any good idea be something people want? Unfortunately not. I think new theorems are a fine thing to create, but there is no great demand for them. Whereas there appears to be great demand for celebrity gossip magazines. Wealth is defined democratically. Good ideas and valuable ideas are not quite the same thing; the difference is individual tastes.

>(1.2 millions apps in each of the apple and gPlay store)"discoverability challenge.": In other words, how will people find your app? Notice I haven't even talked about whether doing an app is economically viable, or whether lack of technical skills is an issue. I'm just asking a basic question: how will users find this thing?

>Here's a hint. If your answer is something like, "My idea is so great, it will just be found by itself," you better have an Instagram up your sleeve. Anything less (and even another Instagram) doesn't stand a chance.

challenge accepted :D

# Monetisation

* **Charge** for it: That’s right, make people have to purchase your product. This can be by setting a price in the Apple App Store, or requiring paid user accounts. Lots of people overlook this route since lots of stuff on the internet is free, but if you’ve made a high quality product it’s worth it! There are loads of companies that sell access to their website, and they do quite well. Consider a one time purchase, or recurring membership fee monthly or yearly. You can start accepting payments with a service called Paypal. You set up an account, direct people to a payment page, and you get money in your email account which can be withdrawn to a real bank at any time.

* Sell **advertising**: This is how most websites start out making money. Other companies have a product of their own they want to sell, so you’ll sell them space on your app/website with a link to their product. If your users are highly specific you may be able to reach out to a few companies to set up deals, but when starting out it’s easiest to join a network that automates this for you. I suggest Google Adsense. Depending on your niche, you could get anywhere from $0.10-$2.00 per click. Google takes a cut of the profit, but it’s worth it because they already have a huge network of advertisers in their system, and all you have to do is place a snippet of JavaScript code on your website.
