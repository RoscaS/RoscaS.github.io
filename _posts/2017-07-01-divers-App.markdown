[* Do you have an epic app idea](https://www.designforfounders.com/app-idea/)  
Il veut vendre son bouquin mais il y a quand même deux trois idées interessantes dans l'article:
Entre autres la prévalence du design sur le soft en lui même pour le prototipage.

Bottom line, on peut avoir zero code et uniquement un concepte en béton + un plan d'interface faite sur photoshop et quand même trouver des investisseurs alors que l'inverse n'est pas possible.


[** idea-paulGraham](http://www.paulgraham.com/ideas.html)

>Treating a startup idea as a question changes what you're looking for. If an idea is a blueprint, it has to be right. But if it's a question, it can be wrong, so long as it's wrong in a way that leads to more ideas.

> why do you need other people? Can't you just think of new ideas yourself? The empirical answer is: no. Even Einstein needed people to bounce ideas off. Ideas get developed in the process of explaining them to the right kind of person. You need that resistance, just as a carver needs the resistance of the wood.

Un peu HS mais j'aime beaucoup:

>Perhaps letting your mind wander is like doodling with ideas. You have certain mental gestures you've learned in your work, and when you're not paying attention, you keep making these same gestures, but somewhat randomly. **In effect, you call the same functions on random arguments. That's what a metaphor is: a function applied to an argument of the wrong type.**

>I found spam intolerable, and I felt it had to be possible to recognize it statistically. And it turns out that was all you needed to solve the problem. The algorithm I used was ridiculously simple. Anyone who'd really tried to solve the problem would have found it. It was just that no one had really tried to solve the problem. 
>**Let me repeat that recipe: finding the problem intolerable and feeling it must be possible to solve it. Simple as it seems, that's the recipe for a lot of startup ideas.**
